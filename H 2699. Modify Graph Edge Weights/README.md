# Intuition
To solve the "Modify Graph Edge Weights" problem, we need to adjust the weights of edges with a value of **-1** so that the shortest path between the given source and destination nodes equals a target value. The key idea is to use Dijkstra's algorithm twice: first, to find the shortest path with current weights, and second, to determine if we can adjust the weights of edges with **-1** to achieve the target distance.

# Approach
1. **Graph Representation** Build an adjacency list from the given edges where each edge is represented with its end nodes and its index.
2. **First Dijkstra Run** Compute the shortest distance from the source to all nodes with current weights. This helps to determine how much distance needs to be added to reach the target distance.
3. **Second Dijkstra Run** Using the computed distances, adjust the weights of edges with **-1** such that the shortest path from source to destination equals the target distance.
4. **Final Adjustment** If the computed shortest distance equals the target, update the edge weights; otherwise, return an empty list indicating it's impossible.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity** $$O((V + E) \log V)$$ where **V** is the number of vertices and **E** is the number of edges, due to the two Dijkstra runs.
- **Space Complexity** $$O(V + E)$$ for storing the graph and distances.

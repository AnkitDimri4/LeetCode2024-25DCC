## Intuition ðŸ§©
The problem asks for the minimum number of obstacles to remove to create a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner in a grid. This can be modeled as a **shortest path problem** where moving through obstacles has a weight of 1, and moving through empty cells has a weight of 0. We use a **0-1 Breadth-First Search (BFS)** approach to efficiently solve this problem.

---

## Approach ðŸŽ¯
**Algorithm Choice** Use **0-1 BFS** with a deque to optimize traversal. In a 0-1 BFS, nodes with weight 0 are added to the front of the deque, and nodes with weight 1 are added to the back. This makes sure that nodes with lower weights are processed first, effectively simulating Dijkstra's algorithm with two-priority levels.
**Initialization** Create a **dist** array to store the minimum obstacles removed to reach each cell. Initialize the starting point with $$dist[0][0] = 0$$ and all other cells to infinity.
**Traversal** Use a deque to perform BFS:
   - For each neighbor $$(nx, ny)$$ of the current cell $$(x, y)$$, calculate the new distance as $$dist[x][y] + grid[nx][ny]$$.
   - If the new distance is smaller than the recorded distance for $$(nx, ny)$$, update the distance and add the cell to the deque. Push to the front if it's an empty cell ($$grid[nx][ny] == 0$$), or to the back if it's an obstacle ($$grid[nx][ny] == 1$$).
   
**Termination** The loop ends when all reachable cells are processed. Return the value at the bottom-right corner $$dist[m - 1][n - 1]$$.

---

### Complexity ðŸ“Š
- **Time Complexity** $$O(m * n)$$ Each cell is processed at most once, and each edge (neighbor) is relaxed once, resulting in linear time complexity relative to the number of cells.
- **Space Complexity** $$O(m * n)$$  The space is used for the **dist** array and deque, both proportional to the grid size.

> ### Explanation of the Code
- **Initialization**
  - A **deque** **dq** is initialized with the starting point $$(0, 0)$$ to perform a 0-1 BFS.
  - A **dist** matrix is initialized with **INT_MAX** to track the minimum obstacles removed to reach each cell, starting with $$dist[0][0] = 0$$.
  - The direction vectors **dx** and **dy** define the possible movements (up, down, left, right).

- **Main Loop**
  - The algorithm processes cells in the deque
    - **Front of the deque** Nodes with fewer obstacles are processed first.
    - For each neighbor $$(nx, ny)$$:
      - **Distance Calculation** Compute $$d = dist[x][y] + grid[nx][ny]$$. If $$grid[nx][ny] == 0$$, no obstacle is removed; otherwise, $$1$$ obstacle is added.
      - **Update Distance** If $$d$$ is smaller than $$dist[nx][ny]$$, update $$dist[nx][ny]$$.
      - **Deque Placement** Push $$(nx, ny)$$ to the front if no obstacle is added ($$grid[nx][ny] == 0$$) or to the back otherwise.
  - This makes sure the shortest path (with the least obstacles removed) is evaluated first.

- **Return**
  - Once the loop completes, the shortest path to the bottom-right corner is stored in $$dist[r-1][c-1]$$. Return this value.

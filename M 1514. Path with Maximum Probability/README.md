# Intuition
To solve this problem, the goal is to find the path with the highest success probability from a given start node to an end node. The approach is similar to finding the shortest path in a weighted graph, but instead of minimizing distance, we're maximizing the probability.

# Approach
**Graph Representation**: Represent the graph with an adjacency list where each node connects to its neighbors with a probability. Use a max-heap (priority queue) to explore nodes, prioritizing those with the highest probability. Apply a Dijkstra-like approach starting from the *start* node with a probability of 1.0. For each node, compute the new probability by multiplying the current probability with the edge's success probability, and if it's higher than the previously recorded probability for a neighbor, update it and push the neighbor onto the heap. Return the probability when the end node is reached, or 0.0 if no path exists.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity** The time complexity is $$O((E + V) \log V)$$ where $$E$$ is the number of edges and $$V$$ is the number of vertices. The priority queue operations contribute to the logarithmic factor.
- **Space Complexity** The space complexity is $$O(V + E)$$ due to the storage of the graph and the max-heap.

# Code
```cpp []

public:
    double maxProbability(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<double>& succProb, int start, int end) {
        vector<vector<pair<int, double>>> graph(n);
        for (int i{0}; i < edges.size(); ++i) {
            int u = edges[i][0], v = edges[i][1];
            double prob = succProb[i];
            graph[u].emplace_back(v, prob);
            graph[v].emplace_back(u, prob);
        }
        priority_queue<pair<double, int>> maxHeap;
        maxHeap.push({1.0, start});
        vector<double> maxProb(n, 0.0);
        maxProb[start] = 1.0;
